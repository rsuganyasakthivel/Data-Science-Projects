Project Overview
This project is regarding data analysis, which uses 'Walmart Retail Sales' dataset from Kaggle. The dataset includes the following:

Store - the store number

Date - the week of sales

Weekly_Sales - sales for the given store

Holiday_Flag - whether the week is a special holiday week 1 – Holiday week 0 – Non-holiday week

Temperature - Temperature on the day of sale

Fuel_Price - Cost of fuel in the region

CPI – Prevailing consumer price index

Unemployment - Prevailing unemployment rate

We are going to do the following:

Basic Statistics tasks
Which store has maximum sales

Which store has maximum standard deviation i.e., the sales vary a lot. Also, find out the coefficient of mean to standard deviation

Which store/s has good quarterly growth rate in Q3’2012

Some holidays have a negative impact on sales. Find out holidays which have higher sales than the mean sales in non-holiday season for all stores together

Provide a monthly and semester view of sales in units and give insights

Statistical Model
For Store 1 – Build prediction models to forecast demand

Linear Regression – Utilize variables like date and restructure dates as 1 for 5 Feb 2010 (starting from the earliest date in order). Hypothesize if CPI, unemployment, and fuel price have any impact on sales.

Change dates into days by creating new variable.
